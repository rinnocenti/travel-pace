# travel-pace
A simple module that calculates the travel time for D&amp;D5e players. it's just a module I'm using to learn how to make modules for foundry.

- Use the information described in pg.84 of the OGL as a calculation rule.
- (tips) Use the lowest speed of the group in feet as a reference.
- (tips) It is implicit that you consider any terrain that does not consist of a road or trail as difficult terrain.

# Manifest

Enter the speed of the group.
Ideally, it should be the lowest speed among everyone in the group.

#### Miles on the road/trails
Enter here the distance traveled by the players on the roads or trails.
Basically this field considers any movement on NOT difficult terrain

#### Miles on the road/trails
Enter here the distance traveled by the players off the roads or trails.
Basically this field considers any movement on the difficult terrain

#### Speed Ratio
sometimes on certain types of land speed is further reduced, usually the players do three miles per hour. however, this average can be changed according to the ground rules.
* Normal (SRD) -> 3 mi/h
* 1/2 Normal -> 1.5 mi/h
* 1/4 Normal -> 0.75 mi/h
* 1/6 Normal -> 0.5 mi/h - ( rules of Icewind Dale: Rime of the Frostmaiden)

#### Estimated Hours
It will display a time estimate for the displayed configuration.It will display a time estimate for the displayed configuration. Presenting the time in the 3 gears, Normal, fast and slow, together with the rules of each one.

#### Forced March
A summary of the forced march rules, if you selected in the settings to display forced march, this text will be sent together with the proposed march for the chat.

#### Buttons
decided which type of gear will be used the player / master presses one of the buttons and a summary of the choices will be sent to the chat.

### On Chat
<img src="https://github.com/rinnocenti/travel-pace/blob/master/img/readme03.jpg" width="50%" height="50%">
A message will be sent to the chat with a description of what was chosen. containing some information:

* Who measure.
* With rate used.
* Many miles in Dificult and Normal terrain
* Estimatade time
* Days for compleat the journey (by rule players can only travel for 8h a day, without the use of forced march.)
* Nonus and Penalties
* (Optional) Rules of Forced March.
